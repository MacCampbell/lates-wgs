Have data from Sam in data/wrasse

gl.vcf = unfiltered data from DArT
bg_metadata_mc.csv = metadata for unfiltered data from DArT

gl.qc.vcf = filtered data with basic quality control:
	- read depth 10X to 200X
	- reproducibility > 90% (see dart for description) 
	- locus callrate (missing data) > 90%
	- minor allele count > 1 (singletons removed)
	- individual callrate > 90%
	- individual heterozygosity > 0.25 (outliers removed, plausible cross-contamination)
bg_metadata_mc_qc.csv = metadata for filtered data with basic qc


hmmm... I don't get the position information, asked Sam.
