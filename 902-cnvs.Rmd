Should be easily able to calculate depth (samtools depth -a ) and create a depth raster.

Queensland
India (east coast and west)
Indonesia (K, SU, SJ)

Need to normalize. Divide by average depth?

1 2 3 = 6, 1/2, 1, 3/2 = 3
1 1 1 = 1, 1 + 1 +1 = 3


```{r}
m58<-read_csv("~/github/lates-wgs/meta/58-Indo-split.csv")
```

```{r}
commands<-m58 %>% mutate(Command=paste0("samtools depth -a ", Path, " | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $3/",Coverage,"}' ", " | grep NC ", ">", " outputs/902/",Run,".coverage"))

commands %>% select(Command) %>% write_tsv("902-coverage.sh", col_names = FALSE)
```
